# Item Icon Font
Turn Minecraft item textures into bitmap font so that they can be used in texts. This resource pack works for all versions from Java Edition 1.13 to the latest release(1.21).

## > How to: Get the resource pack
Go to [release page](https://github.com/DevBobcorn/ItemIconFont/releases) for latest release. Download it and put it into your resourcepacks folder, then load them in resource pack screen.

## > How to: Type these special characters
You can copy them from the lookup table mentioned below. You can either click on an icon to copy that character onto your clipboard and paste directly in game, or click on the codepoint to copy escape sequence for use in json texts(e.g. /tellraw command).

## > How to: Access the lookup table
You can use the online version on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/devbobcorn/pen/MWByWyY?editors=1010). Alternatively you can clone this repo and start a local web server at the root folder(e.g. using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)), and view it at `http://localhost:<port>/lookup%20table/`.
